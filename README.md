# school-web
This is a website for schools. It has 6 types of users mainly, web admin, school admin, staff, teacher, parent and finally student. It has been implemented using HTML and CSS and a little JAVASCRIPT for frontend, PHP for backend and SQL for database part. All of this through LARAVEL platform.
It still has corner cases that hasn't been handled yet and some aesthetic touches to be added to the frontend.
Any contributions will be welcomed.
